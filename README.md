======================

API implementation of Rotten Tomatoes for Drupal

Idea is to make a library of API functions of rotten tomatoes which can be used with Drupal hooks and functions to serve functionalities like

1. basic set of functions to allow users to connect to rotten tomatoes and make api call.
2. search movies by title, rotten id, imdb id.
3. separate functions to get rotten rating for movie by rotten id, get casting of movie.
4. advance search options like search movie by country, latest released, movies making good business.
5. Finally create drupal nodes with returned API data.
